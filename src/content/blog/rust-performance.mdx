# Building High-Performance Systems with Rust

At Trieve, we've built some incredibly fast systems using Rust. Here are some key insights from our journey.

## The 300μs Typo Tolerance System

One of our biggest wins was implementing a typo tolerance system using **BK-Trees** with Redis backing, achieving 300μs response times - **100× faster** than our previous implementation.

### Key Optimizations

1. **Data Structure Choice**: BK-Trees for edit distance queries
2. **Caching Strategy**: Redis for hot path data
3. **Memory Layout**: Cache-friendly data structures
4. **Async I/O**: Non-blocking operations throughout

```rust
// Example: BK-Tree node structure optimized for cache locality
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct BKNode {
    word: String,
    children: SmallVec<[(u8, BKNode); 4]>, // Inline small arrays
}
```

## Scaling ClickHouse Analytics

We also optimized our analytics pipeline:

- **Event Batching**: Reduced database load by 10×
- **Schema Optimization**: Proper column ordering and compression
- **Query Optimization**: Materialized views for common aggregations

## Real-time Hallucination Detection

Our hallucination detection system for RAG systems achieves 67% accuracy using:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for fact extraction
- **Graph-based verification** against knowledge bases
- **Confidence scoring** with uncertainty quantification

## Lessons Learned

1. **Profile First**: Always measure before optimizing
2. **Cache Strategically**: Not everything needs caching
3. **Choose the Right Data Structures**: Algorithm choice matters more than micro-optimizations
4. **Async All the Way**: Don't block the event loop

Building high-performance systems is about making the right architectural decisions, not just writing fast code.
