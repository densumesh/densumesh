# Hey, I'm Dens ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer passionate about building high-performance systems and AI applications. I am currently working as a Jr. Software Development Engineer at **Amazon**, where I build large-scale backend services for vending brands and IP asset management.

As the **first engineering hire** at [Trieve (YC W23)](https://www.trieve.ai), I designed and scaled a distributed search platform that handles millions of queries in under 100 ms. Before that, I contributed to deep-space satellite-communication research in ASU's [Interplanetary Initiative Lab](https://interplanetary.asu.edu/).
