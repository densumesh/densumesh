# Welcome to My New Astro Blog

This is my new personal website, rebuilt from scratch using **Astro** with a focus on minimalism and performance.

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro for several reasons:

- **Built-in MDX support** - Perfect for blog content
- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only ships JS when needed
- **Content collections** - Excellent blog management
- **Static site generation** - Fast loading times

## Design Philosophy

The site follows a minimalistic design with just three colors:

- **Background**: `#1a1a1a` (dark)
- **Text**: `#e8e8e8` (light) 
- **Accent**: `#6aa4f8` (blue)

No gradients, no complex animations - just clean, readable content.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Astro with React integration
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with CSS custom properties
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts throughout
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
- **Content**: MDX for blog posts

## Features

This site includes:

- Responsive design with character unit (`ch`) spacing
- Blog with MDX support
- Project showcase
- Resume/CV section
- Google Analytics integration
- SEO optimization
